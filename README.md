# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a Machine Learning model to detect fake news based on textual content using techniques such as TF-IDF and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

Fake news has become a serious problem in today's digital world. This notebook uses NLP techniques to classify news articles as **real** or **fake**. The pipeline includes:

- Data Cleaning
- Text Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction using TF-IDF
- Model Training with SVM
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- The dataset used is a labeled collection of real and fake news articles.
- You can find the dataset [here](#) *(Update with dataset link if public)*

---

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
